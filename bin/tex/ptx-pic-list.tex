% Format of lines in pic-list file:
%     BBB C.V desc|file|size|loc|copyright|caption|ref
% where BBB is the book code, C.V is the chapter/verse reference,
% and the remaining data corresponds to USFM's \fig marker fields
%
% eg:
% MRK 1.16 |hk00207b.png|span|b||fishermen...catching fish with a net.|1.16

% Compare ptx-adj-list.tex for comments on the code.
